Story: Hi, I am Elena.

The storm rages on, pounding the castle like relentless waves against jagged cliffs. My breath catches in my throat as I choke back sobs that mingle with the howling wind. The parapet feels ice-cold beneath my feet as raindrops carve rivers down my pallid cheeks  The storm rages on, pounding the castle like relentless waves against jagged cliffs. My breath catches in my throat as I choke back sobs that mingle with the howling wind. The parapet feels ice-cold beneath my feet as raindrops carve rivers down my pallid cheeks. Lightning illuminates the sky , casting eerie shadows that dance upon the ancient stones. I cling to the cold, rough edge of the parapet, my fingers trembling and white-knuckled. The thunder roars above, as if nature itself mourns with me.

There he stands—a spectral figure cloaked in mist and sorrow. His eyes mirror my suffering, their once vibrant hue now clouded with the sadness of years long past. The wind whips through his translucent form, blending rain and tears as one. My heart aches with the unbearable weight of both reunion and loss.

"Why?" I cry out, my voice barely more than a whisper carried away by  the storm. "Why did you leave me in this abyss of sorrow?"

His spectral eyes, once brimming with love, now hold only the faintest glimmer of recognition. "Elena," he murmurs, his voice an ethereal echo of what it once was, "I never intended to abandon you." "I never intended to abandon you."

My heart wrenches as I listen to his words, barely audible over the howling wind. "But you did," I whisper, my voice breaking like the waves crashing below. "You left me here in this fortress of desolation, surrounded by shadows and specters of what once was."

His form wavers like a candle flame, and for a moment, I fear he might fade completely. The cold wind screams through the parapet, bringing with it the scent of salt and decay. "It was not by choice," he replies, his voice trembling as though grappling with a reality that  once was."

His form wavers like a candle flame, and for a moment, I fear he might fade completely. The cold wind screams through the parapet, bringing with it the scent of salt and decay. "It was not by choice," he replies, his voice trembling as though grappling with a reality that refuses to be forgotten. My hand reaches out, trembling, to touch his cold visage, but it passes through air tinged with despair. "Why did you leave me?" I whisper, my voice barely audible over the storm's rage.

Thunder drowns his reply; yet in the flash of lightning that follows I see the anguish in his eyes. His spectral hand reaches back, mirroring my own futile gesture. The storm's relentless fury seems to amplify our shared agony, the wind pulling at my hair and dress as if trying to separate us further. "Elena," he murmurs, a sound barely more than the breath  of the storm itself, yet it slices through me like a blade.

"Why did you leave me?" I cry out, my voice mingling with the howling wind. The rain burns on my skin like tears of the heavens themselves, each drop a reminder of my unending sorrow. He moves closer, his eth ereal form shimmering against the stark light of the lightning. "I never left you," he murmurs, his voice a hollow echo that drifts through the desolate library like ghostly fingers brushing over old tomes.

Our eyes meet, and for a moment, time ceases in its relentless march. His gaze holds me captive, and I am lost in the depths of his sorrow as if peering into a mirror reflecting my own despair. His touch is cold, a phantom sensation that sends shivers down my spine yet offers the faintest trace of comfort amidst the torment.

"Every shadow in this castle carries your scent, every whisper  me captive, and I am lost in the depths of his sorrow as if peering into a mirror reflecting my own despair. His touch is cold, a phantom sensation that sends shivers down my spine yet offers the faintest trace of comfort amidst the torment.

"Every shadow in this castle carries your scent, every whisper carries your name," I say, my voice trembling with the weight of unspoken truths. "I never ceased loving you, even as my jealousy drove me to commit the unforgivable."

He remains silent, his spectral form barely swaying in the gusts that howl through the broken windows. His eyes speak volumes as they lock onto mine, a torrent of longing and grief conveyed without words. It's as though every moment we've lost is captured in the depths of his gaze.

"I am bound to you," he finally murmurs, his voice echoing like a distant memory. "Neither life nor death can sever the tether that binds our  souls."

The wind howls, carrying his words across the bridge and into the night. Thunder rumbles ominously above us, a reflection of the turbulent emotions roiling within me. The lanterns flicker as if trying to hold onto their dwindling light just a bit longer.

My eyes never leave his spectral figure, shimmering like a mirage on this desolate stone bridge. His presence is both a balm and a torment to my weary soul. I reach out again, fingers trembling, desperate to feel something more than the cold air where his warmth once existed.

"Elena," he whispers, his voice a haunting echo that seems to come from the very depths of my being. The sound pulls me closer, as if an invisible thread has wrapped itself around my heart, drawing me toward him. 

"Why do you torment me so?" I cry out, my voice breaking like the waves crashing against the rocks below. 

"It's not torment  ," he whispers, his voice a caress against my ears. "It's love's shadow, haunting the remnants of our past."

I step closer to him, feeling the chill of his presence mingle with the damp coldness of the chapel. The moonlight casts fleeting shadows across his ethereal form as if he's only partially tethered to this world. My trembling fingers reach out again, and though I know they will pass through him, I can't resist the need to try. The connection we had once feels so agonizingly close, yet forever out of reach.

"Show me," I plead softly, my voice barely more than a whisper lost in the rustle of wind and ivy. His eyes, filled with a sorrow that mirrors my own, never leave mine as he extends his hand towards the crumbling altar.

"There," he murmurs, pointing to a section covered in tangled vines and moonlit dust. "Beneath the stones lies  a journal, my last message to you."

My breath catches in my throat as I step forward, my feet echoing softly against the cold stone floor. Each step feels laden with the weight of countless memories and unspoken words. The chapel is silent save for the distant rumble of thunder and our whispered laments that linger in the air like mournful ghosts.

My lover's ghost leads me through the moonlit crypt beneath the chapel, his spectral form casting ethereal shadows on decaying stone tombs. His presence is both a balm and a knife, soothing yet slicing through my soul's deepest wounds. The flickering light dances on the ancient walls, creating an otherworldly tapestry of shadows and light. Each shadow seems to whisper secrets of the past, and each flicker reflects the fragments of our lost dreams.

We stop before a worn altar, overgrown with ivy reclaiming what remains of human effort. His ghostly fingers point to a section  of the stone that appears less worn than the others, a section preserved by memories rather than time. As his spectral touch caresses the surface, a hidden compartment creaks open. Inside lies an old locket, tarnished yet somehow gleaming with an inner light.

"My dear Elena," his voice wavers like the "My dear Elena," his voice wavers like the flickering storm outside, echoing through the chamber. I grasp the locket with trembling fingers, its cool metal imprinting sorrow into my skin. Opening it reveals our entwined portraits, frozen in a moment when the world was still filled with promise and love untarn ished by loss. The room quakes under another thunderous roar, and I clutch the locket to my chest, closing my eyes against the flood of memories.

The parapet beneath my feet crumbles as if mimicking the collapse of all I once cherished. Darkness presses in around me, broken only by fleeting flashes  of lightning that cast ghastly shadows on the walls. The wind howls through the gaps in the stone like a mournful dirge, tearing at my hair and dress as if trying to pull me into its cold embrace.

My lover's ghost extends a translucent hand towards me, his eyes filled with an echo of tragic yearning. I reach out desperately, feeling the chill of his ethereal touch just before a blinding flash rips through the night. The lightning bolt crashes into the tower with deafening force, sending shards of stone flying in all directions.

The ground beneath my feet trembles violently as another loud crack reverber ates through the ancient structure. Time seems to slow as I lose my footing, the parapet crumbling beneath me. For a heart-stopping moment, I hang suspended in mid-air, my lover's ghost still reaching out—a figure of spectral sorrow.

Then gravity claims me.

The wind screams past as I plummet  through the storm's fury. My mind flutters to moments of brightness and love. 

The day I first met my lover in the castle’s garden is vivid, despite the rushing abyss. Blossoms swayed gently in a playful breeze, intertwining with his laughter—so vivid against the overgrown ruin surrounding us now through the storm's fury. My mind flutters to moments of brightness and love.

Blossoms swayed gently in a playful breeze, intertwining with his laughter—so vivid against the overgrown ruin surrounding us now. His eyes, warm and inviting, had always made me feel as though the world beyond those castle walls ceased to exist. We carved our initials into the bark of an ancient oak tree, promising eternal love—a promise shattered by my unyielding jealousy and cruel fate.

As I fall through the darkness, memories pierce through  the void, bright and fleeting. I remember the laughter that once filled these halls, now replaced by echoes of sorrow. His eyes haunt me, even as the ground rushes to meet me.

Striking the cold earth, a wave of pain courses through my body before numbness sets in. Darkness engulfs me like a shroud, and for a moment, I think this must be the end. But then, as if summoned by my deepest yearnings, ghostly figures begin to materialize around me. The air crackles with an otherworldly energy; specters of my past loves and family glide through the overgrown garden, their ethereal forms shimmering under the moonlight. I can hardly breathe as they gather closer, their eyes filled with sorrow but also an indescribable tenderness.

My mother steps forward first, her face soft and ageless, free from the ravages of illness that took her away. She reaches out a hand
