Story: Hi, I am Evelyn.

As the wind lashes at my face and rain seeps through my coat, I make my way to the cliffs where Jane hangs perilously. Each step feels like a battle against nature itself, but determination fuels me. The cliffs have always been a place of reckoning for me—a mirror reflecting  my deepest fears and unresolved shadows. Tonight, they demand not just reckoning, but action.

Lightning splits the sky, casting fleeting light on Jane’s pale face below. Her fingers scrabble for purchase on the slick rocks, eyes wide with terror as she glances up at me. Tom's voice strains against the storm below, his desperation mingling with the fury of the wind. I feel the tempest around me, but there's a strange calm within. The cliff's edge slices through my memories, spilling scenes from a childhood scarred by stormy nights and loss.

I call out to Jane, my voice steady despite the chaos. " "Hold on, Jane! I'm coming!"

I begin my descent, each step measured against the slippery rocks. My coat whips around me like a dark ghost; I feel the fabric straining against the relentless wind. As I approach the edge, I see Tom's outstretched hand barely inches from Jane's grasp  as she clings desperately to the jagged cliffside. The storm rages mercilessly, and I pause for a moment, shutting out the chaos to focus. Memories slice through my mind—the sight of my brother slipping through my grasp when we were children, and the haunting vision of that man falling from the lighthouse —I cannot let this happen again.

I steady myself against the relentless wind, my boots sinking slightly into the muddy ground. Lightning strikes nearby, momentarily blinding me, but I force my eyes to stay open, to lock onto Jane's. Her knuckles are white from gripping the crumbling edge. Fear ripples through her eyes, but there's something else—hope. She trusts me, and that belief fuels my determination.

“Hold on, Jane!” I shout against the roaring wind, my voice carrying a hint of the resolve I’ve gathered over years of facing these cliffs and their shadows. My fingers brush her outstretched hand  but she slips again, her screams blending with the storm’s fury. I drop to my knees, digging into the rocky ground for balance as rain lashes my face. 

“Jane, look at me!” I say, my voice unwavering despite the chaos around us. Her eyes lock onto mine, reflecting both terror and a glimmer of hope. The wind howls, and I can feel the cold seep into my bones, but I won't let it deter me. Every muscle in my body tenses as I reach further, my fingers brushing against hers.

The world narrows to this moment—just Jane and me amid the maelstrom The rocks dig painfully into my knees, but I push the sensation aside. Time has slowed, and only our desperate gasps and the relentless storm exist. Her hand is slick with rain and fear; I can feel her slipping away.

"Hold on, Jane," I urge, infusing my voice with the strength I've  always longed to possess. "I'm here with you. We're getting through this."

The wind howls like a beast, tugging at my coat and hair, but I refuse to let it distract me. With every ounce of strength, I inch closer, my fingers brushing Jane's wrist as Tom's stricken face looms above me. The cliff edge crumbles beneath Jane's grip, sending shards of rock tumbling into the churning abyss below. "Jane, hold on!" I shout, my voice cutting through the storm with a ferocity I scarcely recognize in myself.

Tom's tears mix with rain as his outstretched hand trembles, barely holding onto Jane’s other arm. "Don't let go!" he pleads, his voice a desperate whisper lost amidst the tempest.

I tighten my grip on Jane's wrist, feeling her cold, trembling skin beneath my fingers. Her eyes lock onto mine, wide with fear yet flickering with a  glimmer of hope. The wind howls around us, tearing at my coat and sending chills down my spine. But I refuse to let the storm overpower me; my resolve is stronger.

As I inch closer, the rain pelts against my face, stinging like icy needles. Each step feels precarious, the ragged cliff edge beneath my boots threatening to give way with every movement. I hear Tom's voice again, strained and raw, a desperate plea lost in the cacophony of the storm.

Finally, I am within reach. Jane’s fingers are white-knuckled, clinging to an outcropping rock that protrudes precariously above the swirling abyss. Her eyes lock onto mine, wide with terror yet flickering with an unspoken trust. My heart pounds in my chest, each beat a reminder of the urgency at hand.

"Jane," I call out, my voice as steady as I can manage amidst the roaring gale  and crashing waves. The wind whips my hair around my face, blurring my vision momentarily. I blink rapidly to clear the water and strands from my eyes, focusing on Jane’s desperate form.

Tom’s frantic shouts pierce through the storm, "Hold on! We're almost there!" His arm is extended and trembling with strain as he tries to reach Jane. My boots scrape against the loose gravel and slick moss, each step a precarious balance between slipping into the abyss and gaining ground.

"Jane, look at me," I call out, my voice steady despite the chaos enveloping us. "We're going to get through and crashing waves. The wind whips my hair around my face, blurring my vision momentarily. I blink rapidly to clear the water and strands from my eyes, focusing on Jane’s desperate form.

Tom’s frantic shouts pierce through the storm, "Hold on! We're almost there!" His arm is extended  as far as it can go, fingers trembling with effort. I strain forward, my coat heavy and soaked, clinging to my limbs like a second skin. The rain stings against my cheeks, but I concentrate on Jane's face—her pale complexion stark against the dark chasm below.

"Jane!" I call out, my voice barely carrying over the howl of the storm. "Take my hand!" My fingers tremble, every muscle in my body taut with the effort to bridge the gap between us.

Jane's eyes lock onto mine, filled with a mix of terror and hope. She shifts her weight ever so slightly, desperately gripping the slick rock with what remains of her strength. Lightning crackles overhead, illuminating her terrified face for a split second.

"Hold on!" I urge, my voice firmer this time, as if commanding the storm to still. Jane's fear mirrors my own childhood memories of grasping for something solid amid chaos  gripping the slick rock with what remains of her strength. Lightning crackles overhead, illuminating her terrified face for a split second.

"Hold on!" I urge, my voice firmer this time, as if commanding the storm to still. Jane's fear mirrors my own childhood memories of grasping for something solid amid chaos and watching helplessly as it slipped away. The howl of the wind and the roar of the sea below amplify every heartbeat.

Tom's frantic shouts blend with the storm, but I lock eyes with Jane, grounding myself in her desperate gaze. Each step is a battle; my hands ache from gripping the jagged edges of the cliff, fingers numb from the relentless rain. The ground trembles with each thunderous clap, but I push forward, inch by harrowing inch.

"Jane, take my hand!" My voice is a beacon in the tempest. She glances down at my outstretched arm—fear and hope warring  within her eyes. The wind howls, but I stand firm, my coat billowing against the gale. Jane's fingers slip momentarily on the wet rock, sending a wave of terror through me. My heart pounds in sync with the crashing waves below.

"Jane, you have to trust me," I call out , my voice cutting through the tempest. Her eyes lock onto mine, filled with fear but also a glimmer of hope. I inch closer, feeling the cold stone under my sturdy boots, the fabric of my coat whipping fiercely. My hand stretches out further, fingers tingling from both effort and the icy rain.

" "I won’t let go," I promise, my voice unwavering despite the storm. Jane's grip tightens on my hand, her desperation matching mine. With a final surge of strength and resolve, I clasp her hand firmly and pull her towards me. Her weight shifts slowly but surely until she finally collapses into my arms  , drenched and trembling. We both gasp for air, the adrenaline coursing through our veins. The rain starts to lighten, its ferocity giving way to a softer drizzle.

As I help Jane to her feet, the lighthouse beam sweeps over us again, casting long shadows against the jagged rocks. It feels as though the beam is offering us guidance, urging us forward. I clasp Jane's hand tightly, feeling its warmth seep through the chill in my bones. We navigate carefully along the slick rocks, each step a cautious promise not to let the sea reclaim either of us.

The storm's fury wanes further with each passing moment, and the howling winds lose their edge, transforming into a soothing whisper. The echo of past tragedies begins to fade, replaced by the rhythmic crash of waves below—a distant reminder of what we have just endured. The lightning ceases its relentless barrage, leaving behind an ethereal glow from the horizon.

Jane's  momentum falters briefly, but with a final surge of strength and resolve, I clasp Jane's hand and pull her to safety. Her body collapses into my arms as the storm begins to wane. Sobs of relief wrack her frame, mingling with the last remnants of rain on our skin.

" "You're safe now," I whisper softly, holding her tightly against me. The intensity of the moment drips away like the remaining rain off the cliffs. Tom rushes forward, his face a blend of overwhelming relief and lingering worry.

"Evelyn!" he exclaims, his voice cracking with emotion as he embraces both of us, enveloping Jane and me in a protective embrace. The storm's howl is now a distant murmur, replaced by the rhythmic crashing of calmer waves against the shore.

The lighthouse beam sweeps over us again, casting long shadows that dance on the cobbled path below. Its steady light feels like a silent  promise, illuminating the way forward. Tom’s hurried footsteps fall in sync with the heartbeat of the night, his relief palpable as he joins us. Jane's sobs gradually subside into soft whimpers against my coat, her body trembling yet safe in my arms.

The fog rolls in from the sea, cushioning our path back to town. The once violent storm has now calmed to a steady drizzle, drops whispering secrets of the night as they patter against leaves and cobblestones. I feel the wind bending around us, no longer an adversary but a gentle escort towards home.

Jane's grip tightens around my waist as she leans into me, seeking comfort and strength. I rub her back gently, murmuring soothing words to calm her frayed nerves. Tom takes a protective stance beside us, his presence a silent assurance of safety.

We navigate the fog-shrouded path with care, the occasional gust of wind causing Jane to  tremble. I hold her tighter, feeling her shivers as a reflection of my own lingering fears. The lighthouse's glow becomes our anchor, casting long shadows and illuminating our way with its rhythmic sweep.

As we finally reach the end of the path, Tom wraps an arm around both of us, offering silent strength , his warmth seeping through the cold that clings to us. We stand there, a trio bound by a shared terror and newfound resilience, our breaths synchronized in the stillness that follows the storm.

I take a moment to look back at the cliffs, now shrouded in mist but no longer sinister. They tremble. I hold her tighter, feeling her shivers as a reflection of my own lingering fears. The lighthouse's glow becomes our anchor, casting long shadows and illuminating our way with its rhythmic sweep.

As we finally reach the end of the path, Tom wraps an arm around both of us, offering silent strength
