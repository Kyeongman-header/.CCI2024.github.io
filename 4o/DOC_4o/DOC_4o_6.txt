Characters: Sam : 22 years old. a tall, wiry figure. I wears a black trench coat. My hair is unruly and dark. Green eyes peek from beneath my worn cap. Scuffed boots echo on slick pavement as I walk. A silver chain glints around my neck in the neon glow. My hands are hidden in the deep pockets of my coat, fingers brushing cool metal objects inside.

A sudden crack echoes—the sound of betrayal—as the protagonist's closest ally emerges from darkness, eyes glinting with regret and resolve.

Story: I take a deep breath, the cold rain mingling with sweat on my brow, and try to steady my thoughts as I face Alex across the rooftop. Neon lights scatter hues of pink and blue across the wet concrete between us. My black trench coat clings to me like an accusing second skin.

"I guess neither of  us knew it would come to this, huh?" I say, my voice barely audible over the roar of the storm. Alex’s eyes narrow, reflecting a blend of hurt and anger. The barrel of their weapon glistens in the rain.

"You sold us out for a few measly coins," Alex replies, shaking their head in disbelief. "Do you have any idea how many lives you destroyed, Sam?"

I swallow hard, feeling the weight of my guilt pressing down like the heavy rain around us. My fingers continue to tap on the cool metal objects in my pocket, a nervous habit that's never brought any comfort.

"It wasn't just for the money, Alex," I reply, my voice cracking. "I was desperate. My family was falling apart. My mother—she worked herself to death trying to keep us afloat. Dad disappeared without a trace... I thought I had no choice."

Alex takes a step closer, weapon still trained on me but hesitation  evident in their eyes. The rain pours down relentlessly, streaming off the brim of my cap. “And what about all those people, Sam?” Alex shouts back, voice laden with pain and betrayal. “The ones who vanished because of the information you handed over? What about them?”

I tighten my grip on the metal objects in my pocket, feeling their cold firmness as a grounding force amidst the swirling chaos. My heart pounds with desperation, an echo to Alex's accusations.

“They didn't deserve it,” I admit, my voice breaking like waves against stone. “I thought I had no choice—I was wrong. But now... But now, every step I've taken since has been to make it right.” My voice trembles beneath the weight of my words. I watch Alex's jaw clench, their eyes narrowing with a mixture of anger and sorrow.

The rain pounds harder, a cacophony that matches the turmoil within me. “Make it  right? How do you make right what’s been done, Sam? Lives lost, families torn apart. You think you can just erase it all?” His voice wavers, hoarse with emotion and the storm.

I take a step forward, hands still tucked deep in my pockets. “I’m not erasing anything . I’m facing it, Alex. Every rain-soaked night, every flicker of neon light reminds me of the lives I shattered.” My voice cracks, barely audible over the thunder's wrath. My green eyes meet his resolute gaze; there's a storm inside them too.

Alex inches closer, cold rain trickling down his cheeks. "Facing it?" He scoffs, shaking his head in disbelief. "You think standing here drenched in rain makes you a martyr? There's no redemption on this rooftop, Sam."

I flick my trench coat's collar up against another burst of wind and water, fingers still tapping nervously inside my  pockets. The sound of metal resonates with my conflicted thoughts. "I know words won't fix what I've done," I say, my voice subdued but steady against the storm's noise. "But I have to start somewhere, Alex."

He narrows his eyes, rain dripping from his brow as he steps closer, fists clenched at his sides. "Some wounds can't be healed with words, Sam. Actions have consequences."

I glance down at the crowded streets below, dissenters shouting and waving their makeshift banners as the storm rages on. Neon signs flicker ominously, casting a surreal glow on the chaos. " I’ve done terrible things, Alex. But if there's a chance to make things right—”

“Make things right?” he interrupts, his voice cracking. “You can't bring back the dead with your guilt.”

A sharp pang of remorse twists inside me, but I press on. "I can’t undo the past,"  "but I can help shape the future. Let me try, Alex."

He shakes his head, rain streaming down his face like tears. "It's too late for words."

The rooftop is electric with our shared history and the storm's fury. Each raindrop feels like a stinging reminder of my past deeds. "But I can help shape the future. Let me try, Alex."

He shakes his head, rain streaming down his face like tears. "It's too late for words."

The rooftop is electric with our shared history and the storm's fury. Each raindrop feels like a stinging reminder of my past deeds.

" "You were my brother, Sam. We fought together, dreamed of freedom together," Alex's voice wavers as his grip on the weapon tightens.

"I know," I say, my fingers tapping rhythmically on the cool metal objects in my pocket. "Every decision haunts me."

A flash of lightning briefly illuminates  Alex's tear-streaked face. The rain pours relentlessly, mingling with his tears as he pulls out a battered photograph from his coat, thrusting it toward me. I can see the familiar faces of our fallen comrades staring back at me through the raindrops on the glossy paper.

"These are your victims ," Alex says, his voice quivering with grief. The damp photograph trembles in his hand, its edges curling from exposure to the relentless downpour. I take a step back, my boots splashing into a growing puddle on the rooftop.

"Alex, you have to understand—"

"Understand?" He cuts me off, the anger in his voice slicing through the rain like a blade. "Understand what, Sam? That you sold us out for money? That you betrayed everything we stood for?"

I don't flinch as the words land heavily between us. The neon lights flicker erratically, casting spectral shadows on Alex's  face, making his anguish even more pronounced. His eyes, usually so determined, are now pools of anger and sorrow. I open my mouth to speak but am cut off by another crack of lightning and thunder that seems almost synchronized with his pain.

"Do you know what it's like," Alex continues, voice barely above a whisper but carrying the weight of a scream, "to watch everything you fought for crumble because of someone you trusted?" His hands tighten around the photograph, crumpling it slightly. 

A flash of lightning reveals tears mixing with rain on my face. “Alex,” I start, but he lunges at me before I can finish my sentence. His body slams into mine, knocking us both to the rain-slicked ground. The impact reverberates through me like the thunder above. We scramble, limbs entangled in a desperate struggle for dominance.

The photograph flutters from Alex's grip, landing in a puddle to  soak up the neon-tinted water. I manage to get on top, pinning his wrists to the ground with all my strength. Our breaths come out in ragged bursts, mixing with the rain and cries of rebellion below.

"Why?" Alex's voice breaks through the storm, filled with both accusation and a echo of a once unbreakable bond. The pain in his eyes mirrors the turmoil inside me. 

"Do you think this was easy?" I bark, trying to mask my own regret with anger. "Every name, every detail—do you know what it cost me? What it still costs?"

Alex's gaze remains unyielding, but there's a flicker of something—understanding, maybe?—beneath the layers of betrayal. I lean closer, rain dripping from my face onto his.

"I never wanted this," I whisper hoarsely. "I had no choice. You think I didn't hesitate every single time  I slipped them information? You think it didn't tear me apart?"

Alex's eyes narrow, but there's doubt in the firm lines of his face. "How can I believe you now, after everything?" he says, voice breaking over the storm's lingering roar.

The rain eases slightly, almost in response to the raw emotion hanging between us. I wipe my face, though it does little against the relentless drizzle. "I didn't have a choice," I start, my voice desperate and strained. "They threatened to take my sister, Alex. She was all I had left."

Alex shakes his head, but the uncertainty in his eyes is palpable. "Do you have any idea what you've done, Sam? Those people... they depended on us."

I step back, my boots slipping slightly on the wet roof. The neon lights from below flicker like warnings—reminders of every lie told and life lost. "Every night, I live with
