Background: A small village nestles in a snow-covered valley surrounded by dense evergreen trees. Traditional wooden cottages, capped with thick snow, emit a warm and inviting glow. A mountain backdrop cloaked in foggy mist looms, adding a mysterious aura. The pathways are buried under fresh, untouched snow, muffling any sound. Smoke rises gently from chimneys, hinting at the cozier warmth within each home.

Main Plot: A doctor, mid-procedure, suddenly hesitates. Within the womb, an unborn baby encounters medical instruments, representing a significant ethical dilemma.

Story: Hi, I am Lea Seydoux. As I sit by the fireplace in our cozy wooden cottage, the warmth of the flames contrasts sharply with the cold realization stirring within me. My fingers trace the delicate pattern on my journal's cover before opening it to a fresh page. I begin to write, documenting my thoughts on  the day I first encountered a profound ethical dilemma. The memory draws me back to the small, dimly lit clinic nestled amidst our snow-covered village. I was just a child then, but the stark imagery is etched deeply into my mind.

I remember watching the doctor as he prepared for a delicate procedure—his hands steady and his expression focused. The room was filled with an uneasy silence, every breath seeming to hold the weight of the moment. I sat in a corner, curious and anxious, as my mother held my hand tightly.

Suddenly, there was a hesitation—a brief falter in the doctor's movements that seemed to last an eternity  as he withdrew his hand slightly, the medical instrument hovering over the belly of a pregnant woman. My heart pounded in my chest as I watched intently, feeling the tension radiate through the room. The dim light from a single candle flickered softly against the wooden walls, casting long shadows that danced in sync with his hesitation. I remember the faint scent of antiseptic mingling with the smoky aroma of burning wick, embedding itself in my memory. The doctor’s furrowed brow reflected a turmoil within that seemed almost tangible.

In that suspended moment, a profound silence settled over us all, thick and oppressive like the heavy snow outside  . I could see his mind grappling with the enormity of the decision before him, each second a weight on his shoulders. The assistant’s fingers tightened slightly on his shoulder, offering both support and urgency.

The candlelight flickered, casting long shadows that danced across the wooden shelves lined with medical texts and jars of herbs. The room was suffused with a sense of stillness, interrupted only by the occasional crackle of the fire in the small stove. I could almost hear his heartbeat, synchronized with my own anxious breaths.

As a child witnessing this moment, I felt an inexplicable connection to the scene unfolding before me.  Beside the flickering lantern casting a warm light on wooden shelves, I stood motionless, captivated by the tension in the room. The walls seemed to close in as the silence deepened, and every creak of floorboards beneath my feet echoed like a distant memory. The doctor’s hesitation was palpable; his gl oved hands hovering uncertainly above the delicate form beneath him. His uncertainty mirrored my own inner turmoil, a torrent of emotions surging as I remembered.

Suddenly, the scene shifted and I found myself on a mountainous trail, engulfed by whirling snow and treacherous icy slopes. The cold seared my skin  , slicing through my layers of clothing as I trudged forward. My heart pounded against my ribcage, not just from the physical exertion but from a deep-seated fear. The fog was so thick it felt like moving through a dream—or a nightmare—where visibility extended only to the reach of an out stretched hand. Every step was a calculated risk; the snow underfoot could give way at any moment, plunging me into an abyss.

The memories of my friends laughing and chatting just moments before the avalanche struck were fresh and vivid. Their voices, now drowned out by the relentless howl of the wind, echoed in  my mind, mingling with the ghostly whispers of the past. I reached the mouth of the cave, a familiar, foreboding sanctuary. The icy breath of winter seemed to seep into my bones as I ventured inside.

The cavern was illuminated only by the dim glow seeping through cracks in the rock. Every corner of this place held traces of those I lost. The rough, cold walls echoed with faint memories of shared moments—the warmth of their smiles, the resonance of our laughter now swallowed by silence.

I eased myself down on a flat stone ledge that we often rested upon after hours spent climbing. Here, amidst the echoes  of our shared past, I felt their presence most vividly. My fingers traced the scratched messages on the walls, each mark a testament to their resilience and hope despite the overwhelming fear. "Keep fighting," one message read in shaky, hurried script. Another said, "Stay together," as if a whispered plea into the enc asing darkness. The messages were small, almost fragile against the immensity of stone and ice, yet they bore a weight that crushed my heart. I could practically hear their voices, feel their breaths mingling with the cold air around me.

Each night after that discovery, I’d return to the cave as if drawn by  an invisible force, compelled to relive those moments and grasp the threads of hope and fear they left behind. The flickering lantern I carried cast dancing shadows on the cavern walls, animating the messages with a ghostly life. I traced the etchings with my fingertips, feeling a connection that both burdened and anointed me. Their words, hastily carved in a moment of terror yet tinged with bravery, seemed to whisper directly to my soul. I knelt on the icy ground and let their anguish seep into my being, transforming into a haunting blend of sorrow and resolve.

As I delved deeper into the cave,  As I delved deeper into the cave, memories of my tumultuous past resurfaced, mingling with the present's stark reality. The ethereal light cast gentle shadows, and it felt as if the spirits of those lost to avalanches in my childhood were guiding me. The deep-seated pain from losing friends and facing unimaginable hardships had shaped my very essence. Every step I took in the cave, every shimmer of light, brought a memory to the forefront—my friend's laughter before that storm, the warmth of our home before it was buried under snow, and my sibling's innocent smile.

Transfixed by these reflections, I find  myself standing at the threshold of the brightly lit hospital room. The sterile smell, combined with the hum of medical equipment, seems to amplify my pounding heart. As I step inside, memories crash over me like an avalanche—each beeping monitor echoes the heartbeat that was once silenced by nature's ruthlessness.

The doctor’s hands move with deliberate precision, but I catch the slightest tremor—a sign that he's at a critical juncture , as if he is wrestling with the weight of the unborn child's fate. I can see the sweat forming on his brow, each drop a testament to the stakes at hand. 

I take a deep breath, my heartbeat synchronized with the rhythmic beeps from the monitoring machine. My mind races back to those days in our
