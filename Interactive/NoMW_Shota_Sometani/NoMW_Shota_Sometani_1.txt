Story: Hi, I am Shota Sometani. 

The sun hung low in the sky, casting a muted orange glow over the city as I strolled down a bustling street, lost in thought. The weight of my daily grind seemed heavier today—a weariness that stretched beyond physical exhaustion to something more existential. My notebook  Hi, I am Shota Sometani.

The sun hung low in the sky, casting a muted orange glow over the city as I strolled down a bustling street, lost in thought. The weight of my daily grind seemed heavier today—a weariness that stretched beyond physical exhaustion to something more existential. My notebook and papers were stuffed haphazardly into my backpack, a testament to the endless stream of assignments and revisions that awaited me. The sounds of city life—honking cars, snippets of conversation, the distant wail of an ambulance—mingled in a cacophony that only seemed to emphasize my isolation.

The library  was a sanctuary I clung to, my refuge from the chaotic demands swirling outside. Here, time suspended itself in the whispers of pages turning and the soft hum of air conditioning. The flickering fluorescent lights cast ghostly shadows on rows of bookshelves, amplifying the stillness that enveloped me.

I settled into my usual corner study nook, a small alcove bathed in the cold glow of overhead lights. The soft rustle of pages and the occasional shuffling footsteps were my only companions as I hunched over my laptop, fingers flying across the keyboard with mechanical precision. My eyelids grew heavy, betraying my exhaustion,  yet I forced them open, steeling myself against the wave of fatigue threatening to drown my focus. Each ticking second echoed the relentless pressure that weighed down on my shoulders.

The clock struck midnight, yet the end was nowhere in sight. I rubbed my temples, glancing at the empty coffee cups stacked beside me. Stress gnawed at me, but I pressed on. The thought of disappointing myself or my parents kept me anchored to that chair. Even as exhaustion clawed at my consciousness, each completed line of text felt like a small victory in a seemingly endless war.

The secluded study corner was a fortress against distraction. The towering bookshelves  loomed over me, offering a comforting sense of enclosure. The gentle hum of the air conditioning blended with the occasional turn of a page, creating a symphony of quiet diligence. As the clock ticked on, I found solace in these moments of stillness amidst my inner turmoil.

But then, as if puncturing the bubble of my temporary serenity, a sudden commotion shattered the quiet. My eyes were drawn out of the window, and there he was—a man plummeting through the air. The world around me seemed to slow as his desperate arms flailed, silhouetted against the twilight sky. I felt as though gravity's  relentless grip extended to my own heart, pulling it downward with a heavy thud. The once vibrant university courtyard seemed eerily muted, the usual chatter and laughter replaced by gasps of horror and disbelief.

I stood frozen, notebook clutched tightly in my hands. My mind raced through fragments of my past — the long nights spent hunched over textbooks, the unending stream of assignments, and the suffocating pressure to always be at the top. These memories surged like a flood, drowning out the present moment.

A voice broke through my reverie. "Did you see that?" someone whispered, their tone filled with  — the long nights spent hunched over textbooks, the unending stream of assignments, and the suffocating pressure to always be at the top. These memories surged like a flood, drowning out the present moment.

A voice broke through my reverie. "Did you see that?" someone whispered, their tone filled with —both shock and disbelief. I nodded, unable to tear my eyes away from the lifeless form on the ground. The bustling university crowd, usually so familiar and comforting, now felt alien and distant.

My hands trembled as I clutched my notebook tighter, an anchor in this sea of confusion. Fragmented  thoughts swirled in my mind, like leaves caught in a turbulent wind. Each fragment tugged at different memories: nights spent under dim lights, meticulously pouring over textbooks; the hollow victories of high scores; the gnawing ache of exhaustion.

The shadow of the campus clock tower cast long, somber lines over the cobblestone paths, a stark reminder of time slipping through my grasp. It felt as though every tick echoed in the emptiness I had created within myself. The rhythmic sound lulled me into deeper contemplation. 

Moments later, I found solace on a serene bench perched at the edge of campus, overlooking  a sprawling landscape, its beauty bathed in the soft glow of twilight. The golden hues of the setting sun painted a picture of tranquility I had long forgotten. I closed my eyes, taking in the cool breeze that softly rustled the leaves above, carrying with it whispers of reflection and renewal.

As I sat there, I couldn't help but think back to the man I saw falling from the high-rise. The image of his arms flailing in desperation, eyes wide with panic, replayed in my mind like a relentless loop. His fall seemed to echo my own descent into burnout and despair—a haunting parallel that forced me to confront my own  struggles. His final moments were a stark reminder of how fragile life can be, and it ignited within me a profound need to change.

I sat by the quiet riverbank, the gentle rustling of leaves whispering secrets I had long forgotten. The water's surface shimmered under the fading light, creating a mesmerizing dance of reflections. Each ripple seemed to echo the inner tumult I had endured, yet now it carried a promise of calm and clarity.

I reached into my backpack and pulled out my worn notebook, its pages filled with musings, thoughts, and plans that had once dominated my every waking moment. Flipping through  its well-thumbed pages, I paused at a particularly chaotic entry from a few weeks ago. The handwriting was frantic, the lines of text weaving in and out like the jumbled thoughts that had stormed through my mind. These scribbles were once the embodiment of my inner chaos and now stood as a testament to how far I'd come. I closed the notebook and tucked it back into my bag, feeling the cool touch of its worn cover. 

Standing up from the bench, I adjusted my plain white T-shirt and glanced around again at the sunlit courtyard. Students lounged on the grass with textbooks open or chatted animatedly in groups  as the warmth of the setting sun bathed everything in a serene glow. I pulled out my phone and called an old friend I hadn't spoken to in months, arranging a catch-up. The simple act of reconnecting felt like a small victory.

I strolled across the campus, my steps lighter than they had been in weeks. Reconnecting with an old friend had filled me with a renewed sense of purpose. As I approached a quiet café patio, the soft strains of jazz music wafted through the air, creating a peaceful ambiance that seemed to invite reflection and calm.

I chose a table by the edge, shaded by a large umbrella
