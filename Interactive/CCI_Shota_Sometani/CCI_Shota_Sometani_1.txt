Story: Hi, I am Shota Sometani. 

As I made my way to the university roof, I couldn't shake the feeling of a thousand eyes watching my every move—even though the hallway was practically deserted at this hour. My footsteps echoed against the cold tile floors, merging with the hum of fluorescent lights overhead. The  gray metal door to the roof creaked as I pushed it open, revealing a wide expanse of concrete bathed in the soft afternoon light. This was my sanctuary, far from the accusatory stares and endless expectations that plagued me.

I closed my eyes for a moment, feeling the cool breeze brush against my face and ruffle the fringe of my short, straight, black hair. In this solitary moment, the weight of my worries seemed to lift just a little. I could feel the calming softness of the white crew-neck t-shirt against my skin, contrasting with the rough texture of the concrete beneath my feet. 

Opening my eyes , I took in the expanse of the sky above me—endless and free. It was here that I could momentarily forget about the acceptance letter tucked away in my bag like an ominous shadow. The view from up here always put things into perspective, but today it only deepened my internal conflict.

Down  , voices of laughter and clinking glasses filled the living room below. Every joyful noise seemed to pierce through my chest, a stark contrast to the turmoil boiling inside me. I let out a heavy sigh, knowing I should be downstairs celebrating with them. Instead, I remained glued to this rooftop escape.

The acceptance letter , now crumpled in my fist, felt like a betrayal with every crease. I glanced down at it again, the official university seal still catching the sunlight. My name printed in bold letters felt like a branding iron searing into my conscience.

Below me, Mum's laughter rang louder than the rest. It was  a beacon of joy piercing through my cloud of despair. Dad's booming voice quickly followed, echoing up through the staircase as if in celebration of a monumental victory. I felt trapped between their expectations and my deceit—an imposter in my own home.

As I reluctantly descended from the rooftop, the smells wafting into the house became more pronounced. Each step I took felt heavier, as if the very staircase was judging me for my dishonesty. The aroma of Mom's cooking—garlic, ginger, and some rich broth simmering away—seeped through the walls and filled my senses with a warmth that contrasted sharply with  the icy dread clutching my heart. I reached the top of the stairs and paused outside my bedroom door, my hand lingering on the cold metal doorknob, reluctant to turn it. The sound of laughter from downstairs drifted up, a joyful melody that seemed alien to my current state.

As I finally pushed open the door, the familiar sight of my room greeted me—my bed meticulously made, books neatly aligned on the shelf, and my desk, cluttered yet organized in its own way. These were the constants in my life, the elements that stayed unchanged while I navigated the complexities of my emotions and relationships. 

 I stepped inside and closed the door behind me, the soft click offering a semblance of refuge. The room was dimly lit, with only the faint traces of evening sun filtering through the drawn curtains. My gaze drifted to the trophies lining my shelves—the tangible symbols of past triumphs that seemed hollow now.

I  collapsed onto my bed, the springs groaning under my weight. Staring blankly at the ceiling, I felt tears burning in the corners of my eyes. The echoes of my parents' laughter downstairs intensified the crushing weight on my chest, each chuckle a reminder of their expectations and my deception.

The pale moonlight collapsed onto my bed, the springs groaning under my weight. Staring blankly at the ceiling, I felt tears burning in the corners of my eyes. The echoes of my parents' laughter downstairs intensified the crushing weight on my chest, each chuckle a reminder of their expectations and my deception.

The pale moonlight  filtered through the window blinds, casting long shadows that danced eerily across the room. It was suffocating, this blend of guilt and expectation. I pushed myself up reluctantly and glanced at my phone, noting the late hour. Unable to shake off the oppressive feeling, I slipped quietly out of my room.

The cold night air greeted me as I stepped outside, offering a brief respite from my inner turmoil. I made my way across the silent campus, each step echoing my relentless thoughts. The university's rooftop garden had become my sanctuary, an oasis amid chaos. Tonight was no different.

As I climbed the final flight of stairs and  emerged onto the roof, a sense of anticipation stirred within me. The familiar breeze welcomed me, tugging gently at my white t-shirt and tousling my hair. I paused for a moment, taking in the vast expanse of dark sky and distant mountains silhouetted against it. Their unwavering presence offered a comforting contrast to the turmoil churning within me. The stars, scattered like glimmering dust across the canvas of night, felt distant yet oddly assuring. With a deep breath, I walked along the gravel pathway that wound through the rooftop garden.

The faint scent of jasmine and freshly turned earth mixed with the cool air, creating a  sense of tranquillity that contrasted sharply to the turmoil churning within me. The stars, scattered like glimmering dust across the canvas of night, felt distant yet oddly assuring. With a deep breath, I walked along the gravel pathway that wound through the rooftop garden.

The faint scent of jasmine and freshly turned earth mixed with the crisp night air, calming my restless thoughts, if only for a moment. I could hear the city below—a distant hum of life that felt worlds away from the lonely sanctuary I often sought on these sleepless nights.

As I neared the usual bench, I was surprised to see someone already sitting there. The  moonlight painted their face in soft hues, making them almost ethereal. It was the same student I'd met before, the one whose presence had subtly started to intertwine with mine in this hidden corner of the university. We had never exchanged names, but there was an understanding between us—an unspoken agreement that here understood each other's need for solitude and quiet reflection. 

With my white crew-neck t-shirt slightly ruffled from the night breeze and my black hair shuffling gently over my forehead, I approached the bench. My neutral and calm demeanor didn't betray the curiosity brewing inside me. This secluded spot seemed like a sanctuary where our burdens could be laid bare without fear of judgment. I sat down beside them, feeling the familiar wood of the bench creak under our combined weight. The silence was comforting, almost like a warm blanket on a cold night.

Their medium-sized, dark eyes seemed to shimmer under the starlight as they turned to  look at me, a faint glimmer of understanding and kinship in their gaze. "Shota," they began, voice barely above a whisper, "do you ever feel like you're living a lie?"

The question was like an unexpected gust of wind that sent shivers down my spine. I hesitated for a moment before nodding slowly, feeling the weight of the admission pressing down on me. My heart pounded in my chest, loud enough that I feared they might hear it over the gentle rustling of leaves.

"I do," I finally responded, my voice thick with emotion. "Every single day."

The student's expression softened,  before nodding slowly, feeling the weight of the admission pressing down on me. My heart pounded in my chest, loud enough that I feared they might hear it over the gentle rustling of leaves.

"I do," I finally responded, my voice thick with emotion. "Every single day."

The student's expression softened, and they placed a comforting hand on my shoulder. "You're not alone," they said, their voice steady and soothing. The sincerity in their eyes made me feel seen for the first time in ages, like someone had finally pierced through my carefully constructed facade.

We stood there in silence for a moment, letting the quiet companionship  wrap around us like a blanket. The rustling of the autumn leaves below provided a gentle soundtrack, allowing me to momentarily forget about the torturous thoughts that usually clouded my mind. 

As we gazed out over the courtyard, I noticed students forming circles of whispers and concerned glances directed towards us. In the midst of this, my eyes caught sight of a figure standing at the edge, their silhouette framed against the pale blue sky. My heart skipped a beat as I realized what was happening. The person seemed to be on the verge of falling or jumping.

Without a second thought, I dashed towards them, my feet pounding  against the rooftop tiles. My breath came in short, panicked gasps as I reached out, desperately trying to grab hold of them before it was too late. But I was too far away.

I screamed for help, but my voice seemed swallowed by the vast expanse of the courtyard below. Dozens of students were scattered across the campus, oblivious to the drama unfolding above. My mind raced, calculating my next move with the precision that characterizes my every decision. I couldn’t afford to waste any more time. I had to reach out, both physically and emotionally, to stop them from taking that final, irreversible step.

 I scrambled to my feet, my heart pounding in rhythm with the adrenaline surging through me. I stumbled towards the stairwell, almost tripping over loose gravel on the roof. My palms were sweaty, and every second felt like an eternity. I could hear nothing but the frantic beating of my own heart and the occasional  gasp from the people below. The panic in my chest made it hard to breathe, but I forced myself to keep moving. As I burst through the door leading downstairs, I barely noticed the chipped paint on the walls or the echo of my shoes against the concrete steps.

The flight down felt endless, each step bl urring into the next. Finally, I burst out into the courtyard, where the scene was chaotic—a mix of desperate faces and frantic voices. My eyes quickly found the figure on the ground, surrounded by a circle of students and faculty members who looked like they didn’t know what to do.

Emergency responders were already there,  kneeled beside the fallen body, their faces stern and focused. I could hear the murmuring of students around me, speculating on what had just unfolded. My heart pounded as I pushed through the crowd, my mind replaying the horror of that moment. 

The urgency in my step mirrored that of my rooftop companion, who had already reached the scene and was now talking frantically to one of the emergency responders. I could see her face—pale, stricken with fear and concern. She looked up and caught my eye, as if seeking some silent reassurance that I couldn't offer.

As I drew closer,
