Story: Hi, I am Veronica Sawyer. Bow drawn, fingers tingling against the taut string, I stand on the precipice of choice. Each breath is measured, taken deliberately amidst the weighted silence. The clouds overhead swirl in a dance of gray and silver, mirroring the tumult within me. It’s a familiar setting—a  secluded, misty glade at dawn, surrounded by nature's raw tranquility. The scent of damp earth and pine needles fills the air, grounding me in this fleeting moment. 

To my right stands another archer, their presence both a challenge and a mirror to my own struggles. Their expression is intense, eyes seething with a mixture of determination and anxiety. I can almost feel their pulse matching the rhythm of my own racing heart. 

In the stillness, the world seems to hold its breath alongside us. I close my eyes briefly, inhaling deeply the crisp morning air, and exhale slowly to calm my nerves.  I open my eyes and glance at the target ahead, a wooden disc marked with concentric circles that seem to blur and sharpen with each heartbeat. In this secluded clearing, surrounded by trees whispering secrets to the wind, I stand alone yet accompanied by invisible burdens—expectations too weighty for words.

As I readied the second arrow, my thoughts wandered to evenings with my family, gathered around the dinner table. Those nights were a respite from the storm, an anchor in a sea of demands. I aimed carefully, channeling those cherished memories into my shot. The arrow flew forward, representing balance—my love for my family juxtaposed with the need to find my own path.  I released the arrow, watching its trajectory with bated breath. It cut through the thick air and hit the target with a satisfying thud, a symbol of striking that delicate balance between duty and personal happiness. The tension in my shoulders eased slightly, but I knew this was just one step in my journey.

The next step carried me to the edge of the riverbank, where the moon's reflection danced on the surface of the water. I knelt down, dipping my fingers into its cool embrace, feeling a momentary connection with nature that grounded me in my quest for authenticity. The night was serene, yet alive with soft whispers of  wind rustling the leaves and the distant call of an owl. The air around me hummed with an electric energy as the fireflies began their luminescent dance, making the darkness sparkle with possibilities.

With each flicker of light, I recalled moments from my journey: nights spent gazing at constellations seeking answers that only the stars seemed to hold, and afternoons where my journal absorbed every raw thought, doubt, and hope. A pang of sadness accompanied the memory of my friend lost too soon, a bittersweet reminder of how fleeting life is.

I looked down at my bow, feeling its reassuring weight in my hands—the same  solid oak weapon that accompanied me through countless nights of practice, rain or shine. The quiet murmur of the river intertwined with my thoughts as I removed my shoes, feeling the cold earth grounding me. Each step I took shed another layer of external expectation, like peeling away an old skin to reveal something more tender and true , something long buried beneath the veneer of who I was supposed to be. The whispering willow trees swayed gently in the breeze, their leaves brushing against each other like secrets being shared.

I looked up at the moon, its silver light casting an ethereal glow over everything. Fireflies danced around me, their tiny  , glowing bodies creating a constellation of dreams in the night air. Each flicker felt like a promise, a reminder that even in darkness, there is always light to be found.

As I sat by the edge of the river, my reflection stared back at me—imperfect and unrefined but unmistakably me. I whispered softly to my reflection, "I promise to always stay true to you." The words floated across the water, mingling with the soft sounds of the night. I drew my knees closer to my chest, feeling the cool earth through my thin leggings.

The willow trees swayed gently in the breeze, their leaves  whispering secrets of nature's resilience. I let my head rest against the trunk of a nearby tree, feeling its rough bark grounding me. The reflection in the water seemed to ripple with newfound determination. I whispered to it again, "No more hiding, no more pretending."
