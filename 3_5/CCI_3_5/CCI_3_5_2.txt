With confidence, I begin to recite the powerful incantation that will cleanse the city of  its dark energies. The words flow effortlessly from my lips, carrying with them a spark of magic that dances through the air like iridescent butterflies. As the incantation reaches its crescendo, a brilliant burst of light emanates from my medallion, illuminating the plaza with a dazzling display of colors.
